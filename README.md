# Computerised-EF-Tasks-Data-Wrangling

This repository contains the R scripts that I have written for the data wrangling of the four Thinking Games tasks: Colour-Shape, Disks, Patterns, and Soccer. The R codes are adapted from the data cleaning and processing protocol of the Thinking Games Site, orginally written for JMP. Please contact Dr Michelle Ellefson (mre33@cam.ac.uk) for more information on the website and data processing.
