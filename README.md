# Computerised-EF-Tasks-Data-Wrangling

This repository contains the R scripts that I have written for the data wrangling of the four Thinking Games tasks: Colour-Shape, Disks, Patterns, and Soccer. The Thinking Games website development was supported by the Institute of Educational Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant R305A110932 to the University of Cambridge. The opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the Institute or the U.S. Department of Education.

The R codes are adapted from the data cleaning and processing protocol of the Thinking Games Site, orginally written for JMP. Please contact Prof Michelle Ellefson (mre33@cam.ac.uk) for more information on the website and data processing.
